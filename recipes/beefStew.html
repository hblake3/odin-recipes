    <h3><em>This classic French beef stew is the ultimate cold weather comfort food. After a few hours in the oven, the meat becomes meltingly tender and enveloped in a rich wine sauce.</em></h3>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds boneless beef chuck (well-marbled), cut into 1½-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 medium yellow onions, cut into 1-inch chunks</li>
        <li>7 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>1½ tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups dry red wine</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps to Make It</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine flour, garlic powder and salt & pepper. Toss beef in flour mixture. </li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven or pot. Cook the beef and onions until browned.</li>
        <li>Add beef broth and red wine while scraping up any brown bits in the pan.</li>
        <li>Stir in all remaining ingredients except for peas, cornstarch and water. Reduce heat to medium low, cover and simmer 1 hour or until beef is tender (up to 90 minutes).</li>
        <li>Mix equal parts cornstarch and water to create a slurry. Slowly add the slurry to the boiling stew to reach desired consistency (you may not need all of the slurry, if you'd like a thicker stew, you can add extra).</li>
        <li>Stir in peas and simmer 5-10 minutes before serving . Season with salt & pepper to taste.</li>
    </ol>
